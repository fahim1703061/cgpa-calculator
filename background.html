        <h2>How the CGPA Calculator Works</h2>
        <p>The CGPA Calculator takes into account your current CGPA, the number of semesters you have completed, your target CGPA, and the number of semesters after which you want to achieve the target CGPA.</p>
        <p>It calculates the remaining number of semesters and the points required to reach the target CGPA. Then, it determines the required GPA you need to earn in each of the remaining semesters to achieve your target CGPA.</p>
        <p>The calculation is based on the assumption that you will earn the same GPA in all the remaining semesters.</p>
